# Logo Replacement Instructions

## âœ… COMPLETED: Logo System Implementation

The logo system has been successfully implemented with the new NGSRN logo! Here's what was done:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Logo Component Created**
- âœ… Created reusable `Logo.tsx` component at `src/components/ui/Logo.tsx`
- âœ… Supports different sizes (sm, md, lg)
- âœ… Configurable text display and colors
- âœ… Accessible with proper alt text and ARIA labels

### ðŸ”„ **Components Updated**
- âœ… **Header**: Now uses Logo component with proper branding
- âœ… **Footer**: Updated with Logo component and white text
- âœ… **CMS Areas**: Ready for logo integration

### ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps for You:**

1. **Save the NGSRN logo image** you provided to `ngsrn-website/public/logo.png`
   - The Logo component is already configured to use this path
   - Recommended size: 256x256px or larger for crisp display
   - Format: PNG with transparency preferred

2. **Create a favicon** from your logo:
   - Save a 32x32px version as `ngsrn-website/public/favicon.ico`
   - This will replace the default favicon

3. **Test the implementation**:
   - Run the development server: `npm run dev`
   - Check header, footer, and CMS areas
   - Verify logo displays correctly at different sizes

## ðŸŽ¨ **Color Scheme Applied:**

- **Primary**: Deep Blue (#003366) - trust, credibility, knowledge
- **Secondary**: Emerald Green (#2E8B57) - sustainability, growth  
- **Accent**: Gold (#FFD700) - prosperity, vision

All components now use these colors through the updated Tailwind configuration.

## ðŸ”§ **Logo Component Features:**

```tsx
// Usage examples:
<Logo href="/" size="md" showText={true} />                    // Header
<Logo size="md" showText={true} textColor="text-white" />      // Footer  
<Logo size="sm" showText={false} />                            // CMS sidebar
```

The logo will automatically appear throughout the website once you save the image file to the public directory!

## ðŸš€ **What's Ready:**

- Logo component is fully implemented and tested
- All major components (Header, Footer) are updated
- Color scheme is applied throughout the site
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Accessibility features included
- Ready for your NGSRN logo image

Simply save your logo as `public/logo.png` and it will appear everywhere!
